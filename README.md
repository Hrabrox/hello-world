# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

I am writing something random just for the sake of this starting course.

Testing blockquotes:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

Testing inline code:
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

There's a few tasks that need to be completed:
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Testing making a table:
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
